Here, you'll find scripts and a selection of input files for the Dort et al. (2024) paper "Genome-wide gene birth-death dynamics are associated with diet breadth variation in Lepidoptera". Genomes used in this project are publically available, and their original sources are detailed in the supplementary information included with the article. 

From the scripts provided, you should get an idea of how we:
- Annotated genomes with BRAKER2
- Filtered the annotations with AGAT
- Extracted protein sets for each species
- Performed an all-v-all BLAST
- Clustered BLAST results with mcl
- Ran CAFE4 under a variety of settings and parsed output
- Ran our Bayesian analysis of diet breadth vs gene family size
- Built the figures in the paper
